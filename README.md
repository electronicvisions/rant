Ranged Number Types
===================

The RANT Library provides ranged integers and floating point types for C++.

Over and under runs can be both, a correctness and security threat. RANT
therefore provides lightweight runtime checking of ranges. Violations produce
exceptions which can then be safely handled by the program.
